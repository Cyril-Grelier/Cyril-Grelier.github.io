<h1>Welcome !</h1>

I'm currently a research engineer at LERIA, University of Angers, France.
My thesis is about learning-guided metaheuristics for graph coloring problems.
I have mainly worked with local search, memetic algorithms, MCTS and hyperheuristics, as well as on some neural networks and constraint programming.
